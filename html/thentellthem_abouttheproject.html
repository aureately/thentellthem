	<p>What do you think the world needs?</p>
	<p>When asked this question in my design class, I instantly thought: easy-to-use interfaces, an application that pushes people to try new things, games that allow kids (and adults) to learn, motivation, feminism, never-ending curiosity, understanding&mdash;all of which are big ideas, things I'd like to see happen, and things I definitely stand for.</p>
	<p>However, none of these had that <em>oomph</em>, that little feeling one gets when something just feels right. After having finished a project that pushed us to explore who we were as designers, as individual people with voices, complex stories, stylistic preferences, and desires, I felt the need to approach this project on a more personal level.</p>
	<p>What do <em>I</em> need?</p>
	<p>That is how this project started, which, I suppose, is more of an exploration of relationships and partly a campaign to get people thinking about how others treat them and how they, in turn, treat other people, particularly those whom they are close to.</p>
	<p>One of my weaknesses ever since was showing affection; I'm always on my guard, and in the process, there are a lot of things left unsaid for fear of saying too much or being awkward. There is always the assumption that "Oh, they probably get it."</p>
	<p>The previous self-design project made me realize how temporal everything is. How long will I be here? How long will the people I care about be here? Do I matter to someone? Have I told someone that they matter to me?</p>

	<h3>The Project, in parts:</h3>
	<h4>I. Stories</h4>
		<p>These are conversations with different people.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Questions include:
				<ul>
					<li>"Have you ever felt taken for granted?"</li>
					<li>"Have you, yourself, taken anyone for granted?"</li>
					<li>"Who are the most influential people you have in your life?"</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>II. Thoughts</h4>
		<p>My own entries about the experience so far. Plans, fears, realizations.</p>
	<h4>III. Letters</h4>
		<p>A more public approach to this project. Details are still being ironed out.</p>
